MeshLabJS Code Documentation
=========

The main namespace is {@link MLJ.core} and the two main classes are the {@link MLJ.core.Scene} that holds the whole document concept of the system, e.g. the set of meshes on which you work, and the {@link MLJ.core.MeshFile} that actually holds each one of the mesh.
