To build documentation of the javascript classes you have to use nodejs and jsDoc. 
The command is usually something like:

../../sandbox/cignoni/emsdk_portable/node_modules/jsdoc/jsdoc.js -c conf.json 

All the javascript documentation is created in a local 'html' folder that is ignored by git and can be deleted without risks.
